I do not understand the poets who tell me
that I should not personify. Every morning
the willow auditions for a new role</p>
        </div>

        <div class="show circle2">
            <p>
outside my bedroom window—today she is
Clytemnestra; yesterday a Southern Belle,
lost in her own melodrama, sinking on her skirts.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="show circle3">
            <p>
Nor do I like the mathematicians who tell me
I cannot say, "The zinnias are counting on their
fingers," or "The dog is practicing her geometry,"
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="show circle4">
            <p>
even though every day I watch her using
the yard's big maple as the apex of a triangle
from which she bisects the circumference
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="show circle5">
            <p>
of the lawn until she finds the place where
the rabbit has escaped, or the squirrel upped
the ante by climbing into a new Euclidian plane.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="show circle6">
            <p>
She stumbles across the lawn, eyes pulling
her feet along, gaze fixed on a rodent working
the maze of the oak as if it were his own invention,
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="show circle7">
            <p>
her feet tangling in the roots of trees, and tripping,
yes, even over themselves, until I go out to assist,
by pointing at the squirrel, and repeating, "There!
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="show circle8">
            <p>
There!" But instead of following my outstretched
arm to the crown of the tree, where the animal is
now lounging under a canopy of leaves,
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="show circle9">
            <p>
catching its breath, charting its next escape,
she looks to my mouth, eager to read my lips,
confident that I—who can bring her home
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="show circle10">
            <p>
from across the field with a word, who
can speak for the willow and the zinnia—
can surely charm a squirrel down from a tree.
